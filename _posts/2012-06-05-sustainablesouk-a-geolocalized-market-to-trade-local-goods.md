The [SustainableSouk](http://sustainablesouk.com) is an attempt to create a 
geolocalized sustainable system, where super local producers (urban growers, 
small farmers) can find super busy custmers, like students, working people.

Right now we have a problem: people who are living a super hectic life, coming 
back from work very late have no option than hit a supermarket; on the other 
side of the pond we have good quality food produced by Urban Growers and Small 
Farmers who are lacking a distribution channel.

If you are interested into it, in development and or just to participate to the 
beta. just leave a comment below, send me an e-mail, or just get hold of me somehow.

Best,
Michele.
