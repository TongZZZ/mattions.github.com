Science shapes our society, however the general public is not always uptodate
with the latest information and discoveries.

In this light I've joined the EMBL-EBi Science and society program, which organized
an annual conference each year.

I was involved in two conferences in particular, <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Information/events/personalgenome/index.html">The Personal Genome</a> which took place in the 2009, 
addressing the implications of genomic technology applied at individual level, 
and <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Information/events/whoownsscience/index.html">Who 
Owns Science</a>, a conference which I was the main organizer addressing the role 
of Patents and their effect on the scientific discovery.
