Developing complex models (like mine) is only possible if we can reuse and merge 
smaller models. To achieve this we need a system to archive and express models in 
standard way that is no tight to one specific software, it represents the model 
in a not ambigous way, and it's available to everybody.

The idea of having a lego system, where we can plug different models together is 
very appealing in computational neuroscience, and it will give the possibility 
to simulate more complex scenarios.

In systems biology [SBML](http://sbml.org/) is definitively one of the leader of 
this effort. In computational neuroscience a complementary effort is 
[NeuroML](http://neuroml.org). Version 2.0 is under construction; to contribute
or check it out go to the [NeuralEnsemble/libNeuroml repo](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/libNeuroML)
