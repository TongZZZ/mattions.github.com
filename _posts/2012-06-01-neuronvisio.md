Neuronvisio is a Graphical User Interface for NEURON simulator environment with 
3D capabilities. Neuronvisio makes easy to select and investigate sectionsâ€™ 
properties and it offers easy integration with matplotlib for plotting the 
results.

The geometry can be saved using NeuroML and the computational results in a 
customised and extensible HDF5 format; the results can then be reload in the 
software and analysed in a later stage, without re-running the simulation.

## Features

- 3D visualization of the model with the possibility to change it runtime
- Creation of vectors to record any variables present in the section
- Pylab integration to plot directly the result of the simulation
- Exploration of the timecourse of any variable among time using a color coded scale
- Saving the results simulation for later analysis
- Automatic download and running of models in ModelDB
